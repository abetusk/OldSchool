You and anyone you care to invite are invited!

There's going to be at least one live band, "Intelligence Failure", playing, costumes and general revelry. I don't know how well attended it's going to be but I wanted to at least try to do something fun for halloween.

It's going to be on October 29th at the Old School:

855 Five Mile Drive
Ithaca, NY, 14580

I'll hopefully send out a flyer before the event.
